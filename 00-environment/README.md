**Goal: Install the software required to run this tutorial and familiarize with Documentation**

Install/Use the GCC version present on your machine 

All labs will use Make to write build scripts so try to familiarize your self with make.


On some systems qemu is split into multiple binaries. You may want
to call `qemu-system-x86_64 binfile`

GCC can compile assembly code using `gcc -c asm.S -o asm.o`
